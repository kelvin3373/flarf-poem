<h1>  Trouble </h1>

<p>
I've tried not looking at my feet<br>
but am too scared to take more than a step<br>
</p>

<p>
Why is it easier to walk up stairs than down stairs?<br>
What's the proper way?<br>
</p>

<p>
I use an elevator<br>
and say "I'm going downstairs to the first floor"<br>
</p>

<p>
Don't tell Meg I told you<br>
</p>
